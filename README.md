# Green Energy Stocks Analysis

## Overview of Project
Created a VBA-enabled analytical tool to analyze and compare 2017 & 2018 performance of a handful of green energy investment stocks with conditional formatting to highlight results.  The VBA code was refactored to reduce the time to process the performance tables for each year. 

### Purpose
The analysis will support the diversification of a client's green energy investment portfolio to spread risk and improve returns.  The client currently holds only one green energy stock, DAQO New Energy Corp (ticker: DQ).



## Results

### 2017 Performance
2017 was a boom year for green energy stocks with 4 stocks more than doubling their return including DQ.  In 2017, only TERP had a negative return on investment for their shareholders.

### 2018 Performance
Performance for these green energy stocks was not as favorable in 2018.  Most of the stocks had a negative return including DQ which lost in 2018 much of what it gained in 2017.  Only two stocks continued to perform well in 2018, ENPH & RUN.  Both of these stocks had higher daily trading volumes as well.

### Indicated Actions
Further research ENPH & RUN as potential targets for investment to identify if there is still growth potential for these energy stocks.  ENPH has provided high returns the past couple years. 




## Summary

### Refactoring Advantages & Disadvantages
A big advantage of refactoring code is speed, especially where speed provides a competitive advantage.  Refactoring could also potentially fix recurring bugs and should make it easier to maintain and further develop the product.  Disadvantages include potential time it takes to refactor and debug the code for stability, especially if deadlines and timing are an issue.

### Refactoring the Green Energy Stocks VBA Script Pros & Cons
The VBA tool is currently sitting on a cloud drive.  After refactoring the code, the analysis ran 3 to 5 times faster than the base code.  Although runtime difference is noticeable, the run time is not incredibly long for the original VBA tool.   The difference would be more noticeable if used with a larger data set.
