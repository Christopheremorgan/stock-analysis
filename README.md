# Green Energy Stocks Analysis

## Overview of Project
Creat a VBA-enabled analytical tool to analyze and compare the 2017 & 2018 performance of a handful of green energy investment stocks with conditional formatting to highlight results.  The VBA code was refactored to reduce the time it takes to process the performance tables for each year. 

### Purpose
The analysis will support the diversification of a client's green investment portfolio to spread risk and improve returns.  The client currently holds only one green energy stock, DAQO New Energy Corp (ticker: DQ).

## Results

### 2017 Performance
2017 was a boom year for green energy stocks with 4 stocks more than doubling their return including DQ.  In 2017, only TERP had a negative return on investment for shareholders.

### 2018 Performance
Performance for the green energy stocks in the analysis was not as favorable in 2018.  Most of the stocks had a negative return including DQ which lost in 2018 much of what it gained in 2017.  Only two stocks continued to perform well in 2018, ENPH & RUN, and both had high daily trading volumes as well.

### Indicated Actions
Further research ENPH & RUN as potential targets for investment to identify if there is still growth potential for these energy stocks.  ENPH has been the most successful over the past couple years. 


## Summary

### Refactoring Advantages & Disadvantages
Advantage is speed and can be most effective where speed provides a competitive advantage.  Disadvantage is potential time it takes to refactor and debug the code for stability.

### Refactoring the Green Energy Stocks VBA Script Pros & Cons
The VBA tool is currently sitting on a cloud drive and after refactoring the code, the analysis did ran 3 to 5 times faster than the base code.
